# MCP Stacks - Production Maturity Roadmap

## Objective

Transform the mcp-stacks GitOps deployment platform from a functional proof-of-concept into a production-grade infrastructure by implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting, multi-environment workflow isolation, automated testing and CI/CD integration, disaster recovery procedures, and performance optimization. This maturation phase will ensure reliable, scalable, and maintainable MCP server deployments across all Portainer-managed endpoints while expanding the platform's capabilities through Tailscale integration, additional MCP servers, and enhanced documentation.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Service Degradation During Production Rollout
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Introducing monitoring agents, health checks, or configuration changes could destabilize existing MCP services running on Agent and Edge endpoints.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy for critical infrastructure changes
- Deploy monitoring instrumentation to non-production environments first (dev/staging)
- Establish rollback procedures before each major change
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Maintain comprehensive pre-deployment and post-deployment validation scripts

### Risk 2: Secrets Exposure Through Expanded Integrations
**Impact:** Critical | **Probability:** Low

**Description:** CI/CD pipeline integration, monitoring systems, and disaster recovery backups introduce new vectors for credential leakage.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement secrets scanning in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
- Use encrypted backup storage with proper access controls
- Audit all third-party monitoring service integrations for compliance
- Enforce least-privilege access principles across all systems
- Regular security audits of Edge Configs and Portainer environment variables
- Document and enforce secrets rotation policies

### Risk 3: Complexity Overhead Reducing Maintainability
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Adding multi-environment support, CI/CD pipelines, and extensive monitoring could make the system difficult to troubleshoot and maintain.

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain clear documentation for all new components and workflows
- Use infrastructure-as-code principles consistently
- Implement comprehensive logging with centralized aggregation
- Create runbooks for common operational scenarios
- Regular training and knowledge sharing sessions
- Establish clear naming conventions and architectural standards

### Risk 4: Resource Constraints on Edge Devices
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** High

**Description:** Laptops (Edge endpoints) may struggle with additional monitoring agents, health check probes, and increased container overhead.

**Mitigation:**
- Profile resource usage before and after changes
- Implement lightweight monitoring solutions (Prometheus node-exporter, minimal agents)
- Allow opt-out of heavy monitoring on resource-constrained endpoints
- Use polling intervals appropriate for Edge vs. Agent endpoints
- Implement resource limits and reservations in compose files
- Monitor battery impact on laptop endpoints

### Risk 5: Network Connectivity Variability for Edge Agents
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** High

**Description:** Edge agents on laptops experience intermittent connectivity (roaming, VPN transitions), complicating monitoring, alerting, and deployment orchestration.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement grace periods for Edge endpoint alerts (avoid false positives)
- Use Tailscale MagicDNS for more resilient connectivity
- Design monitoring dashboards with "expected offline" states
- Implement local buffering for metrics and logs on Edge devices
- Create separate SLAs/SLOs for Agent vs. Edge environments
- Document expected behavior during connectivity transitions
